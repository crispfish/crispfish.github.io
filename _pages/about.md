H! This is the academic website for Andrew Lee, assistant professor at St. Thomas Aquinas College. Previously, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Santa Cruz under the supervision of <a href='https://www.dancristofarogardiner.com/'> Dan Cristofaro-Gardiner</a>. Before that I was a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, advised by <a href='https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/perutz/'> Tim Perutz</a>.
