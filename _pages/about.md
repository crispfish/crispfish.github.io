Hi! My name is Andrew Lee and I'm an assistant professor of mathematics at <a href="stac.edu">St. Thomas Aquinas College</a>.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
