At UC Santa Cruz in 2018, I founded the <a href="https://science.ucsc.edu/academic-support/mathematics-drp/"> Directed Reading Program </a> in the Mathematics Department, which pairs undergraduate students with graduate students to meet weekly on a reading project of their choice. As far as I know it is still running! I also applied for and received additional funding (through the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/drp-network/home?authuser=0"> DRP Network</a> through their <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1740143&HistoricalAwards=false"> NSF DUE grant</a>) to expand the program and include graduate students from applied mathematics. I also supervised DRP projects for three students in a variety of subjects including machine learning, real analysis, and fair division.

From 2018-2019 I also worked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-hesby-290b0946"> Matt Hesby</a> and gave a series of talks on public-key encryption and RSA at four <a href="https://summitps.org/">Summit Public Schools </a> in Daly City, Redwood City, San Jose, and Sunnyvale, CA.

During Summer 2018 and Summer 2019 I taught courses on Symmetry at the <a href="https://summerinstitutes.spcs.stanford.edu/"> Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes</a>. The 2-week course took an inquiry-based approach to symmetry and group theory by studying symmetries of wallpaper patterns, regular polygons, and simple physical systems.

While at UT Austin I participated in their <a href="https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/drp/"> Directed Reading Program</a> and worked with three students on a variety of topics in differential topology and geometry (the Hairy Ball Theorem, Morse theory, and the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem). I also volunteered in a 2nd grade classroom at <a href="https://www.austinisd.org/schools/maplewood"> Maplewood Elementary School</a> through <a href="https://austinpartners.org/"> Austin Partners in Education</a>. 

From 2010-2011 I served as an Americorps volunteer through <a href="https://www.ndmva.org/serve/americorps/"> Notre Dame Mission Volunteers</a> in <a href="https://www.ndmva.org/serve/americorps/san-francisco-california/"> San Francisco, CA </a>.
