Quantitative Methods for Business and Social Sciences is a general education mathematics course, modeled on introductory courses in quantitative modeling with applications in business. The course assumes no specific background beyond basic mathematics skills, and uses Excel/Google Sheets as an analysis tool.

Since fall 2020 I have taught this course with standards-based grading, with 21 standards in 3 modules covering topics in regression, probability via simulation, and linear optimization.

Semesters taught: Fall 2022, Fall 2021, Spring 2021, Fall 2020, Spring 2020, Fall 2019
