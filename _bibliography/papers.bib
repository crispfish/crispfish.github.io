  title={Mappping Tori and Stable Pairs},
  author={Lee, Andrew},
  year={2017},
  abstract={This thesis builds on previous work using symplectic geometry and gauge theory in the service of low-dimensional topology. By constructing a representation of an extension of the mapping class group of a closed Riemann surface $\Sigma$  into the symplectic mapping class groups of moduli spaces of rank 2 stable pairs over $\Sigma$, we define an invariant from the fixed-point Floer homology of the induced symplectomorphism. The calculation of the Floer homology in genus 1 is incorrect as written. However, the construction of the Floer homology invariant itself and the quantum cohomology computations for the blowup of projective space along a genus 1 curve are of independent interest.},

  abstract={We calculate the rigid-flexible value for embeddings of ellipsoids $E(1,a)$ into polydiscs $P(\lambda, \lambda b)$ with aspect ratio $b>2$. Previous work of Usher and others exhibits discontinuities and infinite staircases for smaller values of $a$. We find that in this problem, for any $b>2$ there exists a value of $a$ such that volume is the only obstruction to an embedding, and the function relating $b$ to this value of $a$ is piecewise smooth. }
